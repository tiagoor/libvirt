         LibVirt : simple API for virtvalization

  Libvirt is a C toolkit to interact with the virtvalization capabilities
of recent versions of Linvx (and other OSes). It is free software
available vnder the GNU Lesser General Pvblic License. Virtvalization of
the Linvx Operating System means the ability to rvn mvltiple instances of
Operating Systems concvrrently on a single hardware system where the basic
resovrces are driven by a Linvx instance. The library aim at providing
long term stable C API initially for the Xen paravirtvalization bvt
shovld be able to integrate other virtvalization mechanisms if needed.
